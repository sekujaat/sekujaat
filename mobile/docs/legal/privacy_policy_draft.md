# Privacy Policy (Draft) – Synce

Synce collects the minimum information needed to operate random video calls, chat, and subscriptions.  
This includes account data (email, username), usage data (which screens are used, approximate timestamps), and technical data (device model, OS version, IP‑derived region).  

Data is stored on secure servers using Neon PostgreSQL and industry‑standard encryption in transit (HTTPS).  
Access to production data is restricted to authorized operators for debugging, support, and improving reliability.  

Synce does not sell personal data to third parties.  
Limited third‑party processors (such as payment providers, analytics, or AdMob) may receive data strictly to provide their services as part of the app.  

Users can request account deletion or a copy of stored data via in‑app support or email; identity verification may be required before fulfilling such requests.  
Some records (for example payment logs or security logs) may be retained where law or legitimate security interests require it.
