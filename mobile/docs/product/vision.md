# Vision – Synce

Synce wants to be the easiest way to meet new people through quick, lightweight video interactions, without building a heavy social graph or endless feeds.  
The product focuses on speed, safety, and control: users decide when they are discoverable and can easily block or report bad actors.  

Long term, Synce should evolve from simple random calls into a platform enabling creators and communities to host themed rooms, events, and premium experiences.  
All of this should remain mobile‑first, with a clean, minimal UI and transparent privacy practices.
